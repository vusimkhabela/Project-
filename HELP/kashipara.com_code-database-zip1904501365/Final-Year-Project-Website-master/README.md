## Introduction

### FRING: A GEOGRAPHY-BASED P2P OVERLAY NETWORK FOR FAST AND ROBUST BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS

Project FRing includes a noval peer-to-peer overlay network protocol that improves communication efficiency and security among peers, and an implementation of the protocol in C++.

### Background

Blockchain is essentially a public decentralized ledger that securely records transactions between parties anonymously. The key component is to reach agreement among a group of nodes, i.e., consensus. However, based on current Peer-to-Peer network, the broadcast operation is inefficient. Increasing transaction rate leads to traffic congestion. 

Intel SGX is a technology which protects code and execution integrity from hardware perspective. It provides chances to modify the network protocol and store some routing information, in order to reduce as many messages as possible and meanwhile retain the properties required by the blockchain application on top of the network. 

This project targets this weakness of the P2P network under blockchain systems, designing and implementing a new protocol in the Peer-to-Peer network which achieves effciency and do not sacrifice any security or any other required properties.
